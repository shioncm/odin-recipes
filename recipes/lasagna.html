    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Lasagna is a type of pasta made of very wide, flat sheets.
        The term can also refer to an Italian dish made of stacked
        layers of lasanga alternating with fillers. The dish may be
        topped with grated cheese, which becomes melted after baking.
        The resulting baked pasta is cut into single-serving square
        portions.

        <li>1 pound bulk Italian sausage</li>
        <li>&frac12; cup warm water</li>
        <li>1 cup sliced black olives</li>
        <li>1 pinch basil</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons garlic powder</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon dried oregano</li>    
        <li>1&frac12; teaspoons dried sage</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons ground black pepper</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons minced garlic</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon dried onion flakes</li>
        <li>2 (14 ounce) jars marinara sauce</li>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) package lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>8 ounces ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>1 pound mozzarella cheese, shredded</li>       
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol class="steps">
        <li>Brown the ground beef and Italian sausage in a large 
            skillet over medium-high heat. Drain excess grease. 
            Stir in the water and black olives, and season with 
            basil, garlic powder, oregano, sage, pepper, minced 
            garlic, and onion flakes. Simmer for about 15 minutes, 
            stirring frequently. Stir in the marinara sauce, and 
            remove from the heat.
        </li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Place a layer of the meat and sauce in the bottom of a 
            9x13 inch baking dish. Cover with a layer of dry 
            noodles. Spread a thin layer of ricotta cheese over the 
            noodles, and sprinkle with a little mozzarella cheese. 
            Cover with another layer of sauce, and repeat layering 
            ending with the meat and sauce on top. Reserve about 
            1/2 cup of mozzarella cheese for later.
        </li>
        <li>Bake for 45 minutes in the preheated oven, but check 
            after 30 minutes depending on how thick the lasagna is. 
            Lasagna is cooked when you can easily stick a knife 
            into it. Sprinkle the reserved cheese over the top, and 
            return to the oven for about 10 minutes for a nice 
            melted cheese topping.
        </li>
    </ol>
