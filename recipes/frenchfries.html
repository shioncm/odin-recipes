    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        French fries are batonnet deep-fried potatoes, possibly 
        originating from France. They are prepared by cutting 
        potatoes into even strips, drying them, and frying them.
        French fries are generally eaten as part of lunch or dinner,
        or by themselves as a snack. They are often salted and 
        may be served with ketchup or other specialties.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul class="ingredients">
        <li>2&frac12; pounds russet potatoes, peeled</li>
        <li>1 cup vegetable oil for frying</li>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garlic salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon onion salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>&frac12; cup water, or as needed</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol class="steps">
        <li>Slice potatoes into French fries and place them into a 
            large bowl of cold water to prevent them from turning 
            brown.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a heavy saucepan or large skillet to 350 
            degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>While the oil is heating, sift flour, garlic salt, 
            onion salt, paprika, and salt into a large bowl. 
            Gradually stir in enough water to make a slightly 
            thick batter that can be drizzled from a spoon.</li>
        <li>Drain fries and pat dry; dip into the batter one at a 
            time and place in hot oil to prevent them from 
            clumping together. Fry until golden brown and crispy 
            on all sides, about 7 to 10 minutes; drain on a paper 
            towel-lined plate.</li>
    </ol>
